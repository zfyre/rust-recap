# rust-recap

Welcome to Rust-Recap! This repository documents my journey of learning the basics of Rust. I have compiled a little bit of everything necessary to get started with Rust programming.

## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. This repository follows the guide provided by [A Gentle Introduction to Rust](https://stevedonovan.github.io/rust-gentle-intro/1-basics.html).
